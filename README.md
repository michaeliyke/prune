# prune
Prune is a file system tool for I'm developing for personal use. It'll focus on making repetitive file system chores a thing that computer handles as opposed to clicking here and there thereby wasting precious time. You'll be able to list what is inside a tree by types or by excluding by types. When you are comfortable what is affected, you can delete, copy or move affected files. Warning: these operations can make you loose precious data so proceed carefully at your own risk. I make no guarantees whatsoever. When you are unsure, use the --dry-run flag to see what is affected without going through the operation. The --dry-run flag short for -d runs through the operation but does not affect your files, it simply displays what will be affected.
